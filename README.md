In this project, we will analyze and predict the win possibilities of deals/projects for an IT consulting company and see how the possibility of winning a
deal is impacted by other variables. This will enable the IT consulting company to manage the effort required to win a deal to meet the growth
targets.
Overview Of the problem:
You have been provided with a single file which contains data related to the projects/deals won or lost. This data contains the project category, price and sector from
2011 to 2018
Steps to be followed:
1. Understanding the problem and Objectives
2. Understand the data develop some business sense
3. EDA (if you require in this case)
4. Provide the results and understanding you got by performing exploratory data analysis.
5. Data Cleaning
6. Model building (trying various techniques and at the end justify why you choose a technique over the others)
7. Testing and cross validation
8. Recommending top 5 combination of SBU Head-Bid Manager.
9. For every false prediction calculate the loss which the company will face.
10. Find the results, recommendation and visualizations
11. Bonus: Any other insight or recommendation that you can give from the data which will help the business(optional)
12. Preparing the deck
The final solution should be in the form of a deck showing all the steps above. It will be judge on the following criteria: - How well you have adhered to the modeling
process discipline. - Do your results make business sense, how have you used business intuition to take decision during the modeling exercise, including but not
limited to the following?
▪ Deciding Segmentation (in case you choose it)
▪ EDA and Feature engineering
▪ Variable and Model selection
Performance of your model
▪ Precision, Recall, Accuracy, AUC
▪ Loss avoided by each model
